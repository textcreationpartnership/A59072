1. MOSES and AARON: A SERMON Preached before the KING at Saxham in the County of Suffolk, April 17. 1670.

    _ 'Tis pity to divide the Text, when the words ſpeak nothing but Ʋnion; I ſhall endeavour to keep my ſelf cloſe to the ſcope of them, whilſt I confine my Diſcourſe unto theſe Three Particulars.

    _ From all which I might raiſe and proſecute this Obſervation;

    _ And, all this not to Jacob and Iſrael onely; but, to Pharaoh and the Egyptians alſo:

    _ They are called Gods upon ſeveral accounts; I briefly inſtance but in two; the Ʋbiquity of their Preſence, the Omniſcience of their Knowledge.

    _ One inference more.

    _ Shall I with all humility and due Reverence, ſpeak the words of truth and ſoberneſs? it is in the Cauſe of God, of the King, and alſo of his Prieſts!

    _ When once there be Diviſions, many are the thoughts, many are the ſearchings of heart! I would not be miſtaken as an evil-ſpeaker, or a fore-boder of evil tidings, while I do thus mournfully, and with all lowly ſubmiſſion crave leave to make out the Parallel:

    _ Of theſe in their order.

    _ Second thing I obſerved to you; The place of their meeting; in a place conſecrated and ſeparated for the Service of God; in Solomons Porch.

    _ Third thing I obſerved unto you in this holy Convention; and that is, their Behaviour at their meeting 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉with one accord.

    _ 1. By whom this diſtance was kept?〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉Of the Reſt. And theſe might be of three ſorts.

    _ Second thing obſerved in this ſecond part of the Text, (to wit) what was the preſent frame and temper of their minds, by whom this due diſtance was kept; 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 No one durſt.

    _ Third thing obſerved in this Second part of the Text; (to wit) the Diſtance which was obſerved at this Convention; and that more ſpecially and particularly, what this Diſtance was? what was that Act which theſe three ſorts of perſons did not dare, or venture to ingage themſelves upon, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 to be too familiar with, to joyn themſelves unto them.

    _ To be a little more cloſe and particular

    _ Second thing now to be conſidered in this Third part of the Text, the Perſons by, and to whom, this reſpect was given; from the People to the Apostles,〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 this the honour of theſe Saints, their Perſons to be had in eſteem amongſt the Multitudes.

    _ Third thing to be conſidered in this third part of the Text, (viz.) the Occaſion of this awful Reverence and Reſpect; at the begining of the 12th verſe;〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. Signes and wonders were wrought by the hands of the Apoſtles amongſt the People;—and the People magnified them.

    _ So that, already you may percieve, that this laſt Diſcourſe is to be confined to theſe two particulars.

    _ Second Part of this Diſcourſe; in which I promiſe all poſſible Brevity; (to wit) what this Benefit redounding ſo upon every account to the Church in a ſettled Community, is? as it may be examined by theſe Particulars!

    _ To be a little more cloſe and particular; The two Verſes will be the Subject of two Diſcourſes: for the first, which is a Deſcription of a bad or a wicked zeal; it is deſcribed to us to be, not as it ſhould be in theſe particulars.

    _ A zeal of Perſons; and thoſe may be of theſe three ſorts; The Clergy; The Laity; or, Perſons in a more mixed and refined Relation; neither one, nor the other particular ſo conſidered; but a certain juncto, or a knot of acquaintance.

    _ In which Zeal is reprehenſible; and that is in relation to the Subject, when the affectators of this kind are not rightly qualified as to affection, or intention;〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 They zealouſly affect; but, not well.

    _ Third Thing in which zeal is reprehenſible; and that in relation to the Zeal it ſelf, when it does in its direct conſequence tend to a ſeparation, and diſunion〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. They would exclude either you, or us; that is, they would ſeparate you from us, and us from you.

    _ One Obſervation more upon this Third thing.

    _ Fourth and Laſt Obſervable, wherein zeal is reprehenſible; and that again, in relation to the zealots themſelves, when they would ſet the Church on fire, to warm themſelves by the flames of it, by gaining Diſciples, not ſo much to their Cauſe, as to their Party; yea, chiefly in this, every private zealot may play a Game by himſelf alone, diſtinct from the reſt of his Company; while they do many times ſupplant one another in gaining Proſelytes to themſelves, being exceeding zealous, that the People might affect them.

    _ Application.

    _ Second part of the Text, Ratio Approbandi; The Reaſon of this Approbation: and that,

    _ 2. Reaſon of this Apoſtolical approbation; and that Taken from the habit;〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. It muſt be alwayes.

    _ Third and Laſt Reaſon of this Apoſtollical approbation, taken from the occaſion of expreſſing it; not only when I, your Apoſtle, am preſent with you.

    _ This is the Sum of the Text, and the Deſign of the enſuing Diſcourſe from theſe words, Let your Moderation be known unto all Men: the Lord is at Hand.

    _ Firſt. What this Moderation,〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 in its ſignification doth moſt properly import?

    _ Second Thing propoſed; how? and in what particular Circumſtances this grace of Moderation is to be manifeſted unto others? 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉let it be known.

    _ Third and Laſt thing propounded (to wit) How the Coming of Chriſt, either in the Fleſh, or to Judgment, is an Argument to us, to improve this Grace of Moderation?

    _ Our Saviour in the Fleſh, God incarnate in his Birth, throughout his Life, but chiefly at his Death, was not only a moſt ſucceſsful example, but a prevailing argument for our Moderation.

    _ The Sum, Concluſion, and Application of all, is briefly this: Let your Moderation be known unto all men; the Lord is at hand:

1.

    _ To be a little more cloſe and particular; The two Verſes will be the Subject of two Diſcourſes: for the first, which is a Deſcription of a bad or a wicked zeal; it is deſcribed to us to be, not as it ſhould be in theſe particulars.

    _ A zeal of Perſons; and thoſe may be of theſe three ſorts; The Clergy; The Laity; or, Perſons in a more mixed and refined Relation; neither one, nor the other particular ſo conſidered; but a certain juncto, or a knot of acquaintance.

    _ In which Zeal is reprehenſible; and that is in relation to the Subject, when the affectators of this kind are not rightly qualified as to affection, or intention;〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 They zealouſly affect; but, not well.

    _ Third Thing in which zeal is reprehenſible; and that in relation to the Zeal it ſelf, when it does in its direct conſequence tend to a ſeparation, and diſunion〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. They would exclude either you, or us; that is, they would ſeparate you from us, and us from you.

    _ One Obſervation more upon this Third thing.

    _ Fourth and Laſt Obſervable, wherein zeal is reprehenſible; and that again, in relation to the zealots themſelves, when they would ſet the Church on fire, to warm themſelves by the flames of it, by gaining Diſciples, not ſo much to their Cauſe, as to their Party; yea, chiefly in this, every private zealot may play a Game by himſelf alone, diſtinct from the reſt of his Company; while they do many times ſupplant one another in gaining Proſelytes to themſelves, being exceeding zealous, that the People might affect them.

    _ Application.

    _ Second part of the Text, Ratio Approbandi; The Reaſon of this Approbation: and that,

    _ 2. Reaſon of this Apoſtolical approbation; and that Taken from the habit;〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. It muſt be alwayes.

    _ Third and Laſt Reaſon of this Apoſtollical approbation, taken from the occaſion of expreſſing it; not only when I, your Apoſtle, am preſent with you.

    _ This is the Sum of the Text, and the Deſign of the enſuing Diſcourſe from theſe words, Let your Moderation be known unto all Men: the Lord is at Hand.

    _ Firſt. What this Moderation,〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 in its ſignification doth moſt properly import?

    _ Second Thing propoſed; how? and in what particular Circumſtances this grace of Moderation is to be manifeſted unto others? 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉let it be known.

    _ Third and Laſt thing propounded (to wit) How the Coming of Chriſt, either in the Fleſh, or to Judgment, is an Argument to us, to improve this Grace of Moderation?

    _ Our Saviour in the Fleſh, God incarnate in his Birth, throughout his Life, but chiefly at his Death, was not only a moſt ſucceſsful example, but a prevailing argument for our Moderation.

    _ The Sum, Concluſion, and Application of all, is briefly this: Let your Moderation be known unto all men; the Lord is at hand:

1. A BAD AND A Good Zeal DESCRIBED and LIMITED.

    _ 'Tis pity to divide the Text, when the words ſpeak nothing but Ʋnion; I ſhall endeavour to keep my ſelf cloſe to the ſcope of them, whilſt I confine my Diſcourſe unto theſe Three Particulars.

    _ From all which I might raiſe and proſecute this Obſervation;

    _ And, all this not to Jacob and Iſrael onely; but, to Pharaoh and the Egyptians alſo:

    _ They are called Gods upon ſeveral accounts; I briefly inſtance but in two; the Ʋbiquity of their Preſence, the Omniſcience of their Knowledge.

    _ One inference more.

    _ Shall I with all humility and due Reverence, ſpeak the words of truth and ſoberneſs? it is in the Cauſe of God, of the King, and alſo of his Prieſts!

    _ When once there be Diviſions, many are the thoughts, many are the ſearchings of heart! I would not be miſtaken as an evil-ſpeaker, or a fore-boder of evil tidings, while I do thus mournfully, and with all lowly ſubmiſſion crave leave to make out the Parallel:

    _ Of theſe in their order.

    _ Second thing I obſerved to you; The place of their meeting; in a place conſecrated and ſeparated for the Service of God; in Solomons Porch.

    _ Third thing I obſerved unto you in this holy Convention; and that is, their Behaviour at their meeting 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉with one accord.

    _ 1. By whom this diſtance was kept?〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉Of the Reſt. And theſe might be of three ſorts.

    _ Second thing obſerved in this ſecond part of the Text, (to wit) what was the preſent frame and temper of their minds, by whom this due diſtance was kept; 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 No one durſt.

    _ Third thing obſerved in this Second part of the Text; (to wit) the Diſtance which was obſerved at this Convention; and that more ſpecially and particularly, what this Diſtance was? what was that Act which theſe three ſorts of perſons did not dare, or venture to ingage themſelves upon, 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 to be too familiar with, to joyn themſelves unto them.

    _ To be a little more cloſe and particular

    _ Second thing now to be conſidered in this Third part of the Text, the Perſons by, and to whom, this reſpect was given; from the People to the Apostles,〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 this the honour of theſe Saints, their Perſons to be had in eſteem amongſt the Multitudes.

    _ Third thing to be conſidered in this third part of the Text, (viz.) the Occaſion of this awful Reverence and Reſpect; at the begining of the 12th verſe;〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. Signes and wonders were wrought by the hands of the Apoſtles amongſt the People;—and the People magnified them.

    _ So that, already you may percieve, that this laſt Diſcourſe is to be confined to theſe two particulars.

    _ Second Part of this Diſcourſe; in which I promiſe all poſſible Brevity; (to wit) what this Benefit redounding ſo upon every account to the Church in a ſettled Community, is? as it may be examined by theſe Particulars!

    _ To be a little more cloſe and particular; The two Verſes will be the Subject of two Diſcourſes: for the first, which is a Deſcription of a bad or a wicked zeal; it is deſcribed to us to be, not as it ſhould be in theſe particulars.

    _ One Obſervation more upon this Third thing.

    _ Fourth and Laſt Obſervable, wherein zeal is reprehenſible; and that again, in relation to the zealots themſelves, when they would ſet the Church on fire, to warm themſelves by the flames of it, by gaining Diſciples, not ſo much to their Cauſe, as to their Party; yea, chiefly in this, every private zealot may play a Game by himſelf alone, diſtinct from the reſt of his Company; while they do many times ſupplant one another in gaining Proſelytes to themſelves, being exceeding zealous, that the People might affect them.

    _ Application.

    _ Second part of the Text, Ratio Approbandi; The Reaſon of this Approbation: and that,

    _ 2. Reaſon of this Apoſtolical approbation; and that Taken from the habit;〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. It muſt be alwayes.

    _ Third and Laſt Reaſon of this Apoſtollical approbation, taken from the occaſion of expreſſing it; not only when I, your Apoſtle, am preſent with you.

    _ This is the Sum of the Text, and the Deſign of the enſuing Diſcourſe from theſe words, Let your Moderation be known unto all Men: the Lord is at Hand.

    _ Firſt. What this Moderation,〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉 in its ſignification doth moſt properly import?

    _ Second Thing propoſed; how? and in what particular Circumſtances this grace of Moderation is to be manifeſted unto others? 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉let it be known.

    _ Third and Laſt thing propounded (to wit) How the Coming of Chriſt, either in the Fleſh, or to Judgment, is an Argument to us, to improve this Grace of Moderation?

    _ Our Saviour in the Fleſh, God incarnate in his Birth, throughout his Life, but chiefly at his Death, was not only a moſt ſucceſsful example, but a prevailing argument for our Moderation.

    _ The Sum, Concluſion, and Application of all, is briefly this: Let your Moderation be known unto all men; the Lord is at hand:
