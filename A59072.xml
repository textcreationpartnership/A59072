         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Some of theſe <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> have already had the honour of your Lordſhips Ear, but I muſt confeſs more ſeaſonable to the times we live in, then ſuitable to that <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> amongſt whom God is praiſed in the <hi>Beauties of his Holineſs,</hi> and it is a joy as well as Comelineſs to behold our <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> the <hi>Auguſt Solemnities</hi> of an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Worſhip, there celebrated, are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a <hi>Continued Praedication</hi> of the Subject Matter here treated on, ſhould I be ſilent, and were theſe lines with their Author buried in Obſcurity: However, amidſt the the daily violences offered to God and his Service from wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Men, it may ſeem requiſite that there be theſe more open Attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto Truth, that ſo a froward and peeviſh Generation may hence be rendred the more inexcuſable, in that they do not periſh without warning.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58881:29"/>he could plead in the ſame words both his <hi>Piety</hi> and his <hi>Innocence—I ſpeak openly to the world; I ever taught in the Synagogue, and in the Temple, whither the Jews always reſort,</hi> and in ſecret <hi>have I ſaid nothing,</hi>

               <p>From our Saviour's <hi>Practice,</hi> we proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what was his <hi>Precept;</hi> and that was this, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2, 3. <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in Moſes's ſeat; all therefore, whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do:</hi> as if, they were the rather to be heard, onely becauſe of a due <hi>Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> and <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> continued amongſt them; however perverſe the <hi>Phariſees</hi> might be in their lives; <hi>they ſay, and do not;</hi> yet <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>obſerve</hi> them, for they do not ſit in the <hi>stool of wickedneſs,</hi> but in the <hi>chair of Moſes.</hi>

               <p>Thus St. <hi>Paul;</hi> that great Apoſtle, who labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the word and Doctrine more then all the reſt, being converted to the Faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.20. Straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way he preached Chriſt <hi>in the Synagogues</hi> that he was the Son of God; <hi>He</hi> being the <hi>Doctor of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> being gone out of the Synagogue, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.42. the <hi>Gentiles</hi> beſought that this word might be ſpoke the next Sabbath Day to them; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they met at the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> even almoſt the <hi>whole City</hi> to hear the word of God. The <hi>ſame Apoſtle</hi> at another time came to <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> where was a <hi>Synagogue</hi> of the <hi>Jews, Act.</hi> 17.1, 2. and (ſays the Text) as his <hi>manner was,</hi> he went in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and three ſabbath days reaſoned with them out of the Scriptures; from <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> we follow him to <hi>Corinth,</hi> Act. 18.2. where he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with and perſwaded both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> but ſtill it was, <hi>in the Synagogue</hi> on the Sabbath day; from <hi>Corinth</hi> we go along with him to <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ver,</hi> 19. he entered into the <hi>Synagogue</hi> and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with the <hi>Jews;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 28. he mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that <hi>Publickly</hi> ſhewing out of the Scriptures that Jeſus was the Chriſt; and in the ſame <hi>chapter, v.</hi> 21. he is very ſollicitous, in <hi>that he muſt by all means keep a feaſt that cometh in Jeruſalem;</hi> and we find him in another place, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.11. <hi>going up to Jeruſalem for to worſhip; haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> at another time <hi>Act.</hi> 20.16. <hi>if it were poſſible for him to be at Jeruſalem on the day of Pentecost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, not onely the <hi>Jewiſh Temple</hi> and <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi> were frequented by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, <hi>ne Judaicum Templum horruerunt,</hi> they

               <p>So far was this <hi>Apostle</hi> from neglecting the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies,</hi> whereſoever he came that it was once part of a miſtaken accuſation againſt him from his own Country men, that he came to them ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that he minded not what company he brought with him thither, <hi>he had brought Greeks along with him into the Temple;</hi> But, the reſpect which he had for the <hi>Temple,</hi> and for ſuch <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>ſolemn Devotion</hi> was as <hi>publique,</hi> as was his frequenting them; for, this was that Apoſtle who was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly careful and ſollicitous leſt places of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worſhip ſhould be prophaned; it was no ſmall trouble to him when he heard that at <hi>Corinth</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">

Thus, as it was with <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, in that <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> of which this <hi>great Redemption</hi> was the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype,</hi> they could not perſwade themſelves that God would viſit them, without a <hi>Miracle;</hi> Exod. 4.8, 9. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs if they will not hearken to the voice of the firſt Sign, that they will beeieve the voice of the latter Sign; and if they will not believe thoſe two Signes, yet a third ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them;</hi> and the <hi>third Sign</hi> was <hi>typical</hi> of a more <hi>deſirable happineſs;</hi> it was <hi>Water turned into Blood,</hi> an intimation, that <hi>Blood</hi> it ſelf in order to <hi>Redemption,</hi> ſhould have a <hi>cleanſing</hi> vertue; So that in the mouth of two or three Witneſſes, the Word of Salvation, whether in the <hi>Type,</hi> or in <hi>Antitype</hi> was eſtabliſhed, God Almighty all along provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the ſatisfaction of common ſence, that men might receive the Truths publiſhed upon the credit of their eyes, and of their eares, as well as they do of other things, which are conveyed to them by the help of their outward ſenſes; and hence a thorow Conviction is wrought upon the very Conſcience: which <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Wonder,</hi> though done ſo long ſince, may ſtill have an influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, in that we have as good reaſon to believe them, as we have to give our aſſent to any thing that has been performed in former Ages; <hi>Our
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58881:73"/>Fathers have told us the mighty works, and the noble acts which God did in their daies, and in the old time before them;</hi> hence from the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> our <hi>Church</hi> has taught us to make this our humble and hearty requeſt, <hi>That God ſtill ariſe in the Defence of his Goſpel, to help and Deliver</hi> the Profeſſors and Diſpenſors of it, <hi>for his names ſake, and for his honour:</hi> He that ſhall call into queſtion, or ſuſpend his belief to the <hi>Hiſtory of Redemption,</hi> as from an <hi>

               <p>Firſt, Is not the Zeal the product of Paſſion more then Piety, the reſult chiefly of the Bodies Conſtitution, rather then of a Virtuous habit and frame of Mind? that Zeal which is the conſequence of mans temper is to be ſuſpect for <hi>choler;</hi> as is <hi>moderation for lukewarmneſs,</hi> which proceeds from an <hi>eaſie facil Diſpoſition;</hi> we are not to aſcribe that
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58881:101"/>to Piety (ſays a late excellent pen) which a man owes to his Complexion, and think Religion makes him zealous, when it is his Conſtitution: Not, by the way, but that a Mans Natural Diſpoſition may be Sanctified, and God may, and does make uſe of our <hi>tempers and inclinations</hi> in order to his ſervice; yet, there is cauſe enough of ſuſpition, when the paſſions are not regulated, or (in the language of the Apoſtle, rather then the Philoſopher) when we have not crucified the affections and the luſts: that zeal is not kindled by a coal from the Altar, in which iniquity is not done away; the lips are ſtill unclean, when in other circumſtances of life, there are the ſame heats, nothing but choler and anger, and that violent, and long continued, upon every little, or no occaſion: They, whoſe hearts are a ſacrifice of holy incenſe, a pure flame, a burnt-offering, a ſweet ſmelling ſavour, acceptable unto God, cannot ſpare any of their heat upon outward provocations; they can paſs by injuries unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and be quiet; ſo God may have his honour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, they value not their own; they have not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up their underſtanding to their ſplene; love and charity is the Rule they walk by amongſt men, and though many times they ſhew themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the cauſe of God, yet it is not ſo much a fretful humour, running in their blood, as the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing and circulation of Grace from the heart: in a word, it is a zeal for Gods Houſe, that it may ſtand, not a deſign to promote their <hi>own houſe,</hi> that it may be exalted higher which doth thus Conſume them; and that is the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Yet once more, and chief of all, his <hi>Death</hi> was the Reconciling of the World unto God and to himſelf; all enmity was ſlain, when he hung upon the Croſs, though bleeding and dying, he was the Prince of <hi>Peace;</hi> herein the love of God toward man appeared, in that while we were yet ſinners and enemies, Chriſt died for us; And ſhall we be froward and peeviſh againſt one another, vexing and fretting our Brethren, for whom Chriſt died; the Legacy that he left us, the Boon that he procured for us, was <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace;</hi> he could not die till he had expreſſed his Charity to the worſt of his enemies, pitying their ignorance, and praying againſt their malice, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do;</hi> And ſhall we live in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and in ſtrife, as if we had no intereſt in this common Salvation, this unſpeakable great Redemption; what ſhall I ſay? To obſerve the ſtrange animoſities and fewds, the contrivances and intreigs of Malice and of anger, by what arts they are induſtriouſly promoted, and wickedly fomented, even amongſt thoſe, who yet profeſs their Faith and Hope in one and the ſame Saviour, would make a man ſometimes ſadly to conclude, that ſuch men are ſo deſperately at variance amongſt themſelves, that they are loth to be reconciled in Heaven it ſelf; theſe little think upon a Saviour, who has made an attonement for them; yea, and though he be ſat down at the right hand of the Majeſty
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:58881:138"/>on high, yet he is riſing out of his place, to <hi>judge</hi> the World for their iniquity; Oh! why then is not our <hi>Moderation</hi> known unto all men, ſince the <hi>Lord, coming to be our judge,</hi> is at hand.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſt coming to Judgment,</hi> to take vengeance of all ungodly ſinners for their wicked deeds, which they have ungodlily committed, is an argument unto us, that if we would then behold our Lord in Righteouſneſs, and with comfort, be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied when we ſhall ariſe in his likeneſs, now in this time, we muſt tread the paths which he has traced for us; follow Peace with, let our <hi>Moderation</hi> be known unto all men, the Lord is at hand.—<hi>The Lord is at hand,</hi> either in a <hi>particular,</hi> or in a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> judgment; for I find the Text Commented up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in both reſpects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In a particular <hi>Judgment;</hi> that is, the Lord is at hand, to viſit upon the City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> all her iniquities, whoſe ſad <hi>Deſolation</hi> was to be, not only a <hi>fore-runner,</hi> but a <hi>clear Type</hi> of the laſt <hi>dreadful Doom:</hi> And this is the Paraphraſe which the moſt litteral and verbal Interpreters of the <hi>New Teſtament-Text</hi> doe give upon this, and the like expreſſions ſcattered and diſperſed, eſpecially, throughout <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Epistolical writings.</hi> Chriſt had fore-told the Deſtruction, both of the City, and the Temple; and this was the expectation of the Chriſtians, looking for the accompliſhment of that Prophecie, aſſuring them, that true was the word which their Lord had ſpoken, and that with ſo much vehemence and eagerneſs, that when he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the thing, he ſaid, <hi>That Heaven and earth
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:58881:139"/>poſſibly might, but not a little, an iota of the word which he had ſpoken, ſhould paſs away;</hi> and <hi>verily,</hi> faith our Saviour, <hi>This Generation ſhall not paſs away until that all theſe things be fulfilled:</hi> this therefore being the general expectation of the <hi>New Converts</hi> unto Chriſtianity amongſt the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> that <hi>Jeruſalem's extirpation</hi> was <hi>nigh at hand,</hi> and that their <hi>Deſtruction</hi> was to be a day of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution,</hi> wherein God would recompence unto the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> all thoſe injuries and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they had raiſed againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in the Plantation of the <hi>Goſpel; When you ſee theſe things come to paſs, lift up your heads with joy</hi> (ſaid our Saviour) <hi>for the day of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption draweth nigh;</hi> that is, in the <hi>Letter,</hi> you ſhall be <hi>Redeemed,</hi> not unlike <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, from <hi>Egypt</hi> and the Houſe of Bondage, God ſhall render tribulation to thoſe that trouble you, and my Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhall run and be glorified, it ſhall be Salvation to the ends of the earth; And ſo the Advice in the Text is very much a word in ſeaſon, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> be not high-minded, but fear, leſt they likewiſe periſh; let their <hi>Moderation,</hi> their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Love and Charity, their impartial pitty and compaſſion, be <hi>known</hi> and extended <hi>un to all Men,</hi> yea, though they have been violent enemies, and cruel, bitter Perſecutors, for the <hi>Lord,</hi> in his <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular judgment</hi> to the <hi>City and Nation of the Jews,</hi> which they all ſo much look for, <hi>is</hi> even now at <hi>hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is not this Leſſon a ſuitable, ſerious, and ſeaſonable advice to us likewiſe? <hi>The Lord is at hand;</hi> Nay, his hand has been hard upon us, in the
